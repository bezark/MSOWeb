<p>Frame 1<br>
In a cave, the dying embers of a fire. A female neanderthal is dimly illuminated, crouching by the fire.</p>

<p>Frame 2<br>
Despite how unlikely this is, we hear: Where are you?<br>
She is looking up.</p>

<p>Frame 3<br>
She stands. We now only see her legs, dimly lit.</p>

<p>Frame 4<br>
She is gone. We see, behind where she had been sitting, the suggestion of the beginning of a pile of bones, dimly lit.</p>
