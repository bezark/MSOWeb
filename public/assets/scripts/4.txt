<p>1898 - Paris</p>

<p>PANEL 1: The eiffel tower looms over two young boys,    WILLIAM and EUGENIO, playing with wooden blocks in a park. WILLIAM’s tie is an American flag, EUGENIO wears an ascot of the spanish flag. </p>

<p>EUGENIO<br>
Then what happened?</p>

<p>WILLIAM<br>
Me and my armies crushed your strong hold! BOOM</p>

<p>EUGENIO<br>
You don’t play fair, William! Look, I’m bleeding!</p>

<p>PANEL 2: WILLIAM and EUGENIO examine EUGENIO’s cut over the now bloody blocks, as FILIPE, a boy dressed in rags looks on from a distance, clutching a block in his hand.</p>

<p>WILLIAM<br>
That’s nothing, Eugenio! Remember the wounds I suffered over the Cuba game?</p>

<p>EUGENIO<br>
Those were my blocks, you thief!</p>

<p>WILLIAM<br>
You’ve held on to too many blocks for too long, amigo. Besides, look at this bloody mess! You don’t take care of them.</p>

<p>PANEL 3: FILIPE runs at WILLIAM and EUGENIO with his single block in hand, we see that the rags he wear come together to form the flag of the Philippines. EUGENIO shrinks to hide but WILLIAM clutches his block harder.</p>

<p>PANEL 4:  FILIPE lies on the ground, in the shadow of the Eiffel tower, blood spilling from his skull. WILLIAM, holding a now very bloody block, and EUGENIO look down at him, unaffected.</p>

<p>EUGENIO<br>
This is why we never invite Filipe to play.</p>

<p>WILLIAM<br>
He always had a violent streak. Couldn’t be trusted. Even with his own blocks. But I guess this means I win them all, eh?</p>

<p>FIN</p>
