<p><em>(Helican and Greep are lying on their planet’s equivalent of a field, looking at the sky.)</em></p>

<p>Greep: Hey Helican?</p>

<p>Helican: Yeah Greep?</p>

<p>Greep: Do you ever think about the tetraverse. </p>

<p>Helican: Of I course I do Greep. </p>

<p><em>(Greep sits up)</em></p>

<p>Greep: Do you ever think about all the plases that have been exploded by stars, or destroyed in a glorgasporg accident, or slowly ripped apart by its own creatures?</p>

<p>Helican. Greep. </p>

<p>Greep: sigh <br>
I just can’t stop thinking about all the earth-friends at the end of their planet days. </p>

<p>Helican: you were always the best at tetraverse history. Why the earth friends? Why not another ancient extinct planet? </p>

<p>Greep: I think it’s kinda neat how they made eye water. </p>

<p>Helican: Oh greep, that’s probably just an old myth. </p>

<p>Greep: I hope not. No other tetraverse </p>
