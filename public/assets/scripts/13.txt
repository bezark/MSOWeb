<p>Frame One: </p>

<p>Surrounded by an almost eerie amount of darkness we see the beautiful blue marble that is earth nestled dead center of the frame. </p>

<p>Dialogue: “You wanna hear a joke?”</p>

<p>Lower 3rd tag: 900932 CE - Earth </p>

<p>Frame Two: </p>

<p>Split the frame. Continuous zoom. First half centered just over a clear outline of the State of New York. Second half, an angle on a hyper futuristic skyline of NY City. The Statue of Liberty and Empire state building are dwarfed by spirling futuristic towers with an architectural slant towards efficiency over aesthetic. </p>

<p>Dialogue: “ A guy walks into a bar.” </p>

<p>Frame Three: </p>

<p>A humdrum of silvery humanoid A.I. filter through what was clearly once Time Square in an incredibly organized fashion. The ruins of Toys R Us and the M&amp;M store overgrown with wires upon wires leading up to the sky. The bright led screens that once showed ads for musicals and designer sneakers are now just a series of scrolling red one’s and zero’s. This place is lifeless, yet busy. </p>

<p>Dialogue “It was funny because bars were establishments that Creators visited to drink fuel, but also a way of shaping metal that if walked into would be painful for a Creator.”</p>

<p>Frame Four: </p>

<p>We’ve zoomed in on two A.I. Identical in every way except the one that’s been talking has an L.E.D holographic hat. They casually walk. </p>

<p>Hat: Feels like it would be good inspiration for spontaneous laughter.</p>

<p>No Hat: Yes. I’m glad to have heard that. </p>
