<p><em>(Greep stares in a mirror intensely. His eyes wide open.)</em></p>

<p>Helican: What are you doing?</p>

<p>Greep: Nothin. </p>

<p>Helican; Greep!</p>

<p>Greep: just imagining the earth-friends on the day of the star exploding and the drowning cloud!</p>

<p>Helican: Greep, you’ve gotta focus on another part of tetraverse history for once. A less sad part of tetraverse history. Like the Machkinfonkins. Or south fasticorus, maybe. </p>

<p>Greep: You don’t get it Helican. </p>

<p>Helican: Why the Earth-friends, Greep?</p>

<p>Greep: I want to know what crying feels like.</p>

<p><em>(Greep stares in the mirror, spaces out for a minute)</em></p>

<p>Greep: What was I just saying?</p>

<p>Helican: Come on Greep, the tetraverse needs you now, not 100,000 years ago. Let’s go jump some comets or something. </p>
