<p>Frame One: A bullet train rushes through the Japanese countryside Toward the skyline of Osaka </p>

<p>Frame Two: A young girl’s face, Toki, is pushed up against the glass. She watches the countryside fly by wistfully. Dreading her destination. </p>

<p>From somewhere behind her we hear: </p>

<p>Dialogue: Toki! Honey, Where are you? </p>

<p>Frame three split: First half, over Toki’s shoulder looking at her mother framed in the doorway. Toki continues to stare out the window. Second half, Mother pulling Toki by the hand out of the room with a slight struggle </p>

<p>Mother: I get that your mad, but hiding is not going to get you anywhere </p>

<p>Frame four: </p>

<p>The bullet train in the foreground, with two small figures that are clearly Mother and Toki walking through it. </p>

<p>Large ominous OSAKA looming over the train in the background. </p>

<p>Toki: I just want to go home.</p>
