<p>2080 CE – An endless shopping mall somewhere on Earth. <br>
Panel One:  A young boy stands in front of a mall directory. He’s wearing a hooded sweatshirt, jeans, sneakers, a baseball cap – very normcore.  It’s not possible to see the names of the stores on either side of him, though we can see an expensive looking chair in the display window of one, and ath-leisure wear in the display window of another. <br>
People stream past him on either side—their faces are all in shadow.<br>
Atop the directory in large multi-colored letters is the word “Google.” The writing on the directory itself is illegible to us. </p>

<p>Panel Two: Zoom in to the same image. The lower-half of the panel is taken up by the back of the boy’s head in shadow – on closer look, there is a small listening device plugged into his right ear. <br>
Out of his ear, a line of dialogue: Your current balance is fifteen-hundred dollars. Would you like to hear your savings—<br>
We can read some of the writing over his head now. Among the listings in the directory, we notice: Serious Eats, Siri, SoundCloud. </p>

<p>Panel Three: The boy is standing in front of a cashier in a dark store – he’s handing the cashier a debit card. <br>
We can’t see the cashier himself, apart from the hand reaching out for the boy’s card. <br>
Behind the boy and on his two sides, some unattributed dialogue. <br>
Do you wanna hear a joke? <br>
What can I help you with?<br>
Where would you like to go? <br>
Sorry, I didn’t quite get that. </p>

<p>Panel Four:  The boy and a tall thin woman wearing a black turtleneck and black pants with a distant look in her eyes sit at a table inside Serious Eats. There are slices of apple pie in front of each of them, untouched.<br>
The boy asks: What do you remember? <br>
The woman says: Sorry, I didn’t quite get that. <br>
The boy asks: Mom? Do you remember me? </p>
