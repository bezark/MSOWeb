<p>STRIP #1. 500 BCE - What is now present-day Redwood National Park</p>

<p>HANK and SHORTER GOD sit on the highest branch of a redwood eating box lunches of light.<br>
We see a forest of redwoods stretching off.</p>

<p>PANEL 1<br>
Hank. What was I just saying?<br>
Shorter God. Giant monkeys.<br>
Hank. Oh yes-</p>

<p>PANEL 2<br>
Hank [cont&#39;d]. -I figure we&#39;ll grow the monkeys real giant-size, too, so when they start having these &quot;new ideas&quot; about things, they&#39;ll be able to do something about it.</p>

<p>PANEL 3<br>
Shorter God. The monkey-size won&#39;t matter so much if the idea-sizes are big-<br>
Hank. Well-</p>

<p>PANEL 4<br>
Shorter God. -And they&#39;ll have so much in their heads, they&#39;ll fast outgrow the need to swing from trees, I imagine.<br>
Hank [clutching the redwood]. But we already built &#39;em so big...</p>
