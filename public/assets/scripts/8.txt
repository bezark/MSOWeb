<p>NYC RUINS 4070 C.E.<br>
A scene of the New York city ruins. Skyscrapers of fantastic shapes in disrepair, reshaping what had been an iconic skyline. The West 4th Street subway station has ruptured from a past disastrous earthquake, and belches its steps out onto the street. The ACE sign, now a fragile artifact, hangs askew. The font and colors are the same, but the letters seem different. Characters evolved from the alphabet we knew. A small black box lies as though dropped in a hurry at the bottom right of the frame. A spaceship shadow at the left of the frame, and the space ship casting it visible, approaching from the distance. VVWOOSSHH.</p>

<p>Panel 2: <br>
A bit closer, from the perspective of the small black box. A small LED on the box has begun to blink. There is a picture on the side, an Ouroboros. The spaceship, closer now. Its shadow just left of the box. BZRT. We hear the radio transmission. <br>
“Anticlea to MARS 218. Mission: Terran Reconnaissance.”<br>
“Received.  Where are you?”<br>
“Site A24 - NYC.”</p>

<p>Panel 3:<br>
Even closer, from the perspective of the small box, which is now directly under the shadow of the spaceship. Five small LED lights blink, but not quite brightly enough. We can see now that there is more writing on the side – but we can’t quite make it out. We hear the radio transmission.<br>
    “Biosphere depleted. No signs of intelligent or stupid life to report.”<br>
    “Be serious. We have to cover North America today.”<br>
    “Understood. Permission to lightwarp to DC?”<br>
    “Granted. Stay safe, Anticlea.”<br>
Panel 4:<br>
Very close on the box. The shadow and the ship are gone. We can now read the text on its side:<br>

There is an epitaph: When I get there, how will I know it’s you? </p>
