                        <p>This is the first iteration of a digital, interative comic book about time travel and memory.</p> 
                        <p>John and I first came up with this idea in 2015, in a coffee shop in downtown Northampton, MA. I drew a time traveling knight in my notebook, John had some bright ideas about it, and just like that, we were planning a generative, infinite comic book that spans the entirety of spacetime.</p> 
                        <p>We talked about it on bus trips to Pittsburgh, on plane rides to Los Angeles, on road trips and after long shifts at work. We read books by Richard McGuire and James Gleick and tried to figure out how time travel works (spoiler alert: It doesn&#8217;t). We wanted to make this comic book happen, but had no idea where to start, and no idea how to make it as big as we wanted it to be. After a couple of attempts, we crawled away from the project, feeling defeated and overwhelemed.</p> 
                        <p>Then, earlier this year, I felt excited about approaching the project once again. We reached out to 13 of our favorite writer friends, used some newfound skills, and gave it a try. It&#8217;s not as big as we want it to be, and it&#8217;s not generative at all, and (as of September 2018) it doesn&#8217;t even have color. Even our poor time traveling knight has disappeared, replaced by You, the intrepid viewer.</p> 
                        <p>But, unlike those ardent conversations from 2015 on, we actually made something. Which means we&#8217;re once step closer to a generative, infinite comic book that spans the entirety of spacetime. Perhaps, by the end of the century, when we&#8217;re both uploaded to the Cloud and actually understand eternity, we will have finally succeeded in our idealistic goals. Until then, enjoy our tiny corner of the infinite universe.</p>
